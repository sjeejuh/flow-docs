Objects
-------

In computer science, an object is a location in memory having a value and referenced by an identifier. An object can be a variable, function, or data structure. In the object-oriented programming paradigm,"object," refers to a particular instance of a class where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures. In relational Database management an object can be a table or column, or an association between data and a database entity.

Attributes
----------
An attribute is a specification that defines a property of an object, element, or file. It may also refer to or set the specific value for a given instance of such.
