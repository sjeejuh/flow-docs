Flow Software - User Manual
====================================

`Flow`_ is a configuration based calculation and reporting engine. It integrates directly into and extends the Wonderware Suite of products, namely Wonderware Historian and Wonderware Intelligence. 

Measures are reporting points-of-interest which are configured in the Flow architecture. They automatically retrieve data from underlying Historians or SQL databases, aggregate, and calculate. 

Reports are configured in a drag & drop environment, no scripting required!
